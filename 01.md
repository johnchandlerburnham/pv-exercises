# Chapter 1: The Vim Way

### Tip 1: Meet the Dot Command

- `.`: repeat last change
- `u`: undo last change
- `d`: delete `{motion}`
- `dd`: delete line
- `>`: indent `{motion}`
- `>G`: increase indent until end of file
- `i`: enter insert mode
- `<Esc>`: exit insert mode

### Tip 2: Don't Repeat Yourself

- `$` move to end of line (buck stops here)
- 'a' append after current position
- 'A' append after line

Two for the Price of One
- `A` is `$a` append at end of line
- `C` is `c$` change to end of line
- `s` is `cl` substitute one to right
- `S` is `^C` substitute line
- `I` is `^i` insert at start of line
- `o` is `A<CR>` open a new line
- `O` is `ko` open a new line above

### Tip 3: Take One Step Back, Then Three Forward

- `s` substitute
- `f` find a character
- `;` repeat last search

### Tip 4: Act, Repeat, Reverse

- `@:` repeat Ex command
- `&`  repeat last :s[ubstitute] command
- `t`  toward (one before) a character
- `F`  find backwards
- `T`  toward backwards
- `n`  repeat `/` or `?` search
- `N`  repeat `/` or `?` search backwards
- `qx{changes}q`  quote changes as "x"
- `@x` repeat changes quoted as `x`

### Tip 5: Find and Replace by Hand

- ``*`` search for word

### Tip 6: Meet the Dot Formula

- {move}{execute} pattern. One keystroke to move, one to make a change. e.g.
`n.` or `;.`
