# Chapter 2: Normal Mode

## Tip 7: Pause with Your Brush Off the Page

- Normal Mode is resting state

## Tip 8: Chunk Your Undos

- Return to normal mode to create a logical "change" unit that could be undone
- `<Esc>o` instead of `<CR>` opens a new line in a separate change unit
- Arrow keys in insert mode create a new undo chunk

## Tip 9: Compose Repeatable Changes

- `daw` delete a word

## Tip 10: Use Counts to Do Simple Arithmetic

- `<C-a>` add [count] to the number at or after the cursor
- `<C-x>` subtract [count] to the number at or after the cursor

## Tip 11: Don't Count If You Can Repeat

- using `.` and repeating commands creates a more granular undo history
- doing addition in ones head is also tedious
- but using numbers can be better if chunking the individual commands makes
  little sense

## Tip 12: Combine and Conquer

- Operator + Motion = Action

- `c` change {motion}
- `d` delete {motion}
- `daw` delete a word
- `dap` delete a paagraph
- `gu` make {motion} lowercase
- `gU` make {motion} uppercase
- `gUaw` make a word uppercase
- `gUU` make line uppercase
- `~` swap case under cursor
- `g~` swap case for {motion}
- `>` shift indent right for {motion}
- `<` shift indent left for {motion}
- `<<` shift line indent left
